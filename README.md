# Spark On

Based on the `Spark On` blog post series at [47D Blog](http://www.47deg.com/blog/tags/sparkonletscode) I want to:
  - upgrade dependencies
  - use scala.js for the frontend
  - learn about akka-remoting
  - add CQRS / Eventsourcing
over time as I learn more about AKKA.
## App Requirements

* Twitter Credentials to connect to the Twitter API. Read more about it [here](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation).
* In this README.md file you will see the IP address `192.168.99.100`. If you are using [docker-machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/), `docker-machine ip <machine-name>` command should return the specific host’s IP address. You must replace `192.168.99.100` for the IP address in your case.
* The whole infrastructure has been tested on an Apple Macbook Pro (2,7 GHz Intel Core i5, 16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3).

To start off, we need to define a few environment variables in this [config file](https://github.com/47deg/spark-on-lets-code/blob/master/scripts/sparkOn.env#L5).

## Deploy Docker Infrastructure

### Start Cluster

We've defined a bash script to deploy all of the cluster dependencies, including the Spark Streaming Application, which means, we can run it in this way:

    scripts/deploy.sh

By default, the infrastructure deployed will be:

- Spark Cluster:
    - 1 Spark Master
    - 2 Spark Worker nodes
- Cassandra Cluster:
    - 2 Cassandra Docker Containers
    - 1 Docker Container with [DataStax Opscenter](http://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise-visual-admin)
- Kafka Cluster:
    - 1 Docker node Zookeper
    - 3 Docker containers running as Kafka brokers
- Hadoop HDFS Cluster:
    - 1 Docker container running as namenode
    - 1 Docker container running as datanode
- 1 Docker container for our Streaming App

### Scaling Out Services

For instance, to increase the Spark Workers available:

    docker-compose scale spark_worker=5

### Start the Streaming

If everything is functioning correctly, we can start the Twitter Streaming as follows:

    curl -X "POST" "http://192.168.99.100:9090/twitter-streaming" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d $'{
      "recreateDatabaseSchema": true,
      "filters": [
        "lambda",
        "scala",
        "akka",
        "spray",
        "play2",
        "playframework",
        "spark",
        "java",
        "python",
        "cassandra",
        "bigdata",
        "47 Degrees",
        "47Degrees",
        "47Deg",
        "programming",
        "chicharrones",
        "cat",
        "dog"
      ]
    }'

### Connect to the Web Socket

For instance, you could use [Simple WebSocket Client](https://goo.gl/8Jw6K) for Google Chrome, opening the connection in this URL ws://192.168.99.100:9090/trending-topics .

### Stop Cluster

We can stop the streaming gracefully, before stopping the cluster:

    curl -X "DELETE" "http://192.168.99.100:9090/twitter-streaming"

And then, from the shell:

    cd scripts
    docker-compose stop
    docker-compose rm

# HTTP Application API - FORMAT: 1A

## Spark Streaming Status Endpoint [/twitter-streaming]

Start, stop and fetch the Spark Streaming Context status in the application. Note: once you have stopped the context you can not start again.

### Get Streaming Status [GET]

+ Response 200 (application/json)

        {
            "message": "The streaming has been created, but not been started yet"
        }

### Start Streaming [POST]

This action allows you to stop the Spark Streaming Context.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

        {
            "message": "Started"
        }

+ Response 400

### Stop Streaming [DELETE]

This action allows you to start the Spark Streaming Context.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

        {
            "message": "The streaming has been stopped"
        }

+ Response 400

## WS Filtered Twitter Word Tracks [WS /trending-topics]

Open a websocket in order to show each new filtered track word is found.
